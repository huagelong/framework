# Repr

[![Build Status]](https://travis-ci.org/IcecaveStudios/repr)
[![Test Coverage]](https://coveralls.io/r/IcecaveStudios/repr?branch=develop)
[![SemVer]](http://semver.org)

**Repr** provides a way to generate informational string representations of any value, inspired by Python's
[reprlib](http://docs.python.org/release/3.1.5/library/reprlib.html) library.

* Install via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org) package [icecave/repr](https://packagist.org/packages/icecave/repr)
* Read the [API documentation](http://icecavestudios.github.io/repr/artifacts/documentation/api/)

## Example

Use the ```Repr::repr()``` method to obtain a string representation for any type.

```php
use Icecave\Repr\Repr;

echo Repr::repr(array(1, 2, 3));
```

The output from the example above is:

```
[1, 2, 3]
```

### Arrays

Arrays are represented using PHP 5.4 style short array notation. By default a maximum of 3 elements are shown along with
a count of any additional elements. Nested arrays are represented up to 3 levels deep by default, with any arrays nested
deeper than this showing only the element count.

### Numeric Values

Numbers are represented naturally, floating point values will always display a decimal point even if representing a
whole number.

### Strings

Strings are represented enclosed in double quotes up to a default maximum length of 50 characters. Any control
characters are shown as escape sequences.

### Objects

Objects are represented as a class name and SPL object hash enclosed in angle brackets. If the object has a `__toString`
method, the result of this is shown after the class name according to the rules of string representations specified
above.

If an object implements [RepresentableInterface](/IcecaveStudios/repr/blob/master/lib/Icecave/Repr/RepresentableInterface.php),
the result of its stringRepresentation() method is used instead.

### Resources

Resources are represented as a resource type and ID enclosed in angle brackets. Stream resources will also display the
stream mode.

### Other Types

All other types are represented by the result of [var_export()](http://php.net/manual/en/function.var-export.php) in
lowercase.
